📘 Title

Visual Dynamic Language (VDL): Structured Representation of Visual Events and Semantics for LLMs in Real Time

🎯 Purpose

VDL is an extension of VSL (Visual Scene Language), enabling language models and AI systems to perceive and interpret dynamic visual streams — including video, real-time camera input, AR/VR interaction, or gameplay footage — through a structured, machine-readable layer of semantic information.

📐 Core Idea

VDL translates visual motion and scene transitions into a format that LLMs can reason about — just like VSL enables static scene representation. It introduces a temporal layer over VSL with tracked changes, actions, states, and interactions.

🧱 Structure Example (VDL JSON Snippet)

{
  "timestamp": 1.24,
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "person1",
      "type": "human",
      "position": {"x": 100, "y": 300},
      "state": "walking",
      "direction": "right",
      "speed": 1.2
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "enter_scene",
      "target": "person1"
    }
  ]
}

🔄 Temporal Semantics

VDL introduces time-awareness:

timestamp or frame_id

object lifecycle: appears, transforms, disappears

action state: walk, turn, sit, interact, signal

inter-object relations: follow, collide, support, respond

📡 Use Cases

Real-time visual assistants (AR glasses, robotics, surgery tools)

Video comprehension and semantic summarization

Game world state interpretation

Human behavior modeling

Event-based video editing or synthesis

🔁 Integration with VSL

VDL is not a separate format, but a dynamic extension to Visual Scence Language (VSL). Every frame or segment builds upon the VSL structure — enriched with change tracking, temporal logic, and motion semantics.

💥 Why It Matters

This is not just video analysis. It's machine cognition over time:

Perception becomes structured

Reasoning becomes stateful

Actions can be grounded in observed visual change

Just as VSL gives LLMs a way to think about space,
VDL gives them a way to think about change.

🧠 Note from the Author

VDL continues the journey that began with VSL: transforming language models into structured visual thinkers.It is proposed as an open direction for experimentation, research, and standardization in AI spatial-temporal reasoning.
