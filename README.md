### 📘 Title

**Visual Dynamic Language (VDL): Structured Representation of Visual Events and Semantics for LLMs in Real Time**

---

### 🎯 Purpose

VDL is an extension of VSL (Visual Scene Language), enabling language models and AI systems to perceive and interpret **dynamic visual streams** — including video, real-time camera input, AR/VR interaction, or gameplay footage — through a structured, machine-readable layer of semantic information.

---

### 📐 Core Idea

VDL translates visual motion and scene transitions into a format that LLMs can reason about — just like VSL enables static scene representation. It introduces a **temporal layer** over VSL with tracked changes, actions, states, and interactions.

---

### 🧱 Structure Example (VDL JSON Snippet)

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1.24,
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "person1",
      "type": "human",
      "position": {"x": 100, "y": 300},
      "state": "walking",
      "direction": "right",
      "speed": 1.2
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "enter_scene",
      "target": "person1"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 🔄 Temporal Semantics

VDL introduces time-awareness:

* `timestamp` or `frame_id`
* `object lifecycle`: appears, transforms, disappears
* `action state`: walk, turn, sit, interact, signal
* `inter-object relations`: follow, collide, support, respond

---

### 📡 Use Cases

* **Real-time visual assistants** (AR glasses, robotics, surgery tools)
* **Video comprehension** and semantic summarization
* **Game world state interpretation**
* **Human behavior modeling**
* **Event-based video editing or synthesis**

---

### 🔁 Integration with VSL

VDL is **not a separate format**, but a **dynamic extension** to Visual Scence Language (VSL). Every frame or segment builds upon the VSL structure — enriched with change tracking, temporal logic, and motion semantics.

---

### 💥 Why It Matters

This is not just video analysis. It's **machine cognition over time**:

* Perception becomes structured
* Reasoning becomes stateful
* Actions can be grounded in observed visual change

> Just as VSL gives LLMs a way to think about space,
> VDL gives them a way to think about **change**.

### 🧠 Note from the Author

VDL continues the journey that began with VSL: transforming language models into structured visual thinkers.
It is proposed as an open direction for experimentation, research, and standardization in AI spatial-temporal reasoning.
